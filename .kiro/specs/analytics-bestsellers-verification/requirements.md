# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on verifying and enhancing the accuracy of the `GET /api/vendor/:vendorId/analytics/bestsellers` endpoint. The goal is to ensure proper calculation of revenue, units sold, ratings, and reorder rates while adding comprehensive test coverage and query parameter support for filtering and pagination.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a vendor, I want accurate bestseller analytics calculations so that I can trust the revenue and sales data for my products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating product revenue THEN the system SHALL compute SUM(orderItems.quantity * orderItems.unitPrice) per product
2. WHEN calculating units sold THEN the system SHALL compute SUM(orderItems.quantity) per product
3. WHEN calculating product ratings THEN the system SHALL compute the average rating from all reviews for that product
4. WHEN calculating reorder rate THEN the system SHALL compute repeatCustomers / totalCustomers for the vendor where repeatCustomers are those with â‰¥2 orders

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a vendor, I want the bestsellers endpoint to handle edge cases gracefully so that the system remains stable with incomplete or missing data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product has zero revenue THEN the system SHALL include it in results with revenue = 0
2. WHEN a product has no ratings THEN the system SHALL include it in results with rating = null or 0
3. WHEN a product has no orders THEN the system SHALL include it in results with appropriate zero values
4. WHEN invalid data is encountered THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a vendor, I want the bestsellers endpoint to only show my products so that I cannot access other vendors' sensitive business data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting bestsellers for a vendor THEN the system SHALL only return products belonging to that vendor
2. WHEN calculating metrics THEN the system SHALL only include order data for the specified vendor's products
3. WHEN a vendor requests another vendor's data THEN the system SHALL return only their own data or appropriate authorization error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a vendor, I want to filter and paginate bestseller results so that I can analyze specific time periods, categories, and manage large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing 'from' parameter THEN the system SHALL only include orders from that date onwards
2. WHEN providing 'to' parameter THEN the system SHALL only include orders up to that date
3. WHEN providing 'limit' parameter THEN the system SHALL return at most that many results
4. WHEN providing 'category' parameter THEN the system SHALL only include products from that category
5. WHEN no parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return all bestsellers for the vendor

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the bestsellers endpoint so that I can confidently deploy changes and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL verify all calculation formulas are correct
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL verify edge cases are handled properly
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL verify vendor scoping works correctly
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL verify query parameters work as expected
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use realistic seed data with varied scenarios
