## üöÄ How to Enable

### Option 1: Side-by-Side Testing
The new components are in separate files, so you can test them alongside the existing views:

1. In `client/src/components/OperationsDashboard.tsx`, add imports:
```typescript
import HealthIncidentsViewNew from './ops/HealthIncidentsViewNew';
import RunbooksToolsViewNew from './ops/RunbooksToolsViewNew';
```

2. Add a new view to the navigation:
```typescript
const views = [
  { id: 'health', label: 'Health & Incidents', icon: Activity },
  { id: 'health-new', label: 'Health & Incidents (New)', icon: Activity }, // Add this
  { id: 'runbooks', label: 'Runbooks & Tools', icon: BookOpen },
  { id: 'runbooks-new', label: 'Runbooks (New)', icon: BookOpen }, // Add this
  // ... other views
];
```

3. Update the render section:
```typescript
{selectedView === 'health-new' && <HealthIncidentsViewNew />}
{selectedView === 'runbooks-new' && <RunbooksToolsViewNew />}
```

### Option 2: Replace Existing Views
Simply replace the imports and usage:
```typescript
import HealthIncidentsView from './ops/HealthIncidentsViewNew'; // Changed
import RunbooksToolsView from './ops/RunbooksToolsViewNew'; // Changed
```

## üîß Configuration

### SLA Defaults
Configured in `incident-management.service.ts`:
- SEV1: 15m mitigation, 2h resolution
- SEV2: 1h mitigation, 8h resolution
- SEV3: 4h mitigation, 24h resolution  
- SEV4: 24h mitigation, 7d resolution

### Services List
Update in `IncidentFilters.tsx`:
```typescript
const SERVICE_OPTIONS = ['api', 'worker', 'web', 'database', 'redis', 'email', 'stripe', 'webhooks'];
```

### Review Cadence
Default 90 days, configurable per runbook in database

## üß™ Testing

### Test Incident Creation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/ops/incidents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Incident",
    "severity": "SEV3",
    "summary": "Testing the new system",
    "affected": ["api", "database"]
  }'
```

### Test Runbook Creation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/ops/runbooks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Runbook",
    "incidentType": "TEST",
    "contentMarkdown": "# Test\n\n1. Step one\n2. Step two",
    "service": ["api"],
    "severityFit": ["SEV3", "SEV4"],
    "estimatedDuration": 15
  }'
```

## üìù What's Next (Optional Enhancements)

### High Priority
- [ ] Incident detail drawer (full CRUD for title, severity, owner, tags)
- [ ] Timeline event composer (add NOTE, ACTION, UPDATE events)
- [ ] Post-mortem form (structured fields + action items)
- [ ] Policy prompts (close without post-mortem warning)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Runbook creation form (markdown editor with preview)
- [ ] Runbook checklist mode (step-by-step execution)
- [ ] Cross-link incidents ‚Üî runbooks
- [ ] Owner/team picker UI

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Export incidents to PDF
- [ ] Runbook templates (SEV1, Deploy, DB)
- [ ] Automation bindings UI
- [ ] External integrations (Jira, PagerDuty)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch incidents"
- Check backend is running
- Verify admin authentication
- Check browser console for CORS errors

### Drag-and-drop not working
- Ensure `@dnd-kit/core` is installed
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- Try refreshing the page

### Markdown not rendering
- Verify `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` are installed
- Check runbook has `contentMarkdown` field (not `content`)

### SLA times incorrect
- Backend calculates from `startedAt` timestamp
- Check system timezone settings
- Verify `slaMitigateMinutes` and `slaCloseMinutes` are set

## üìö File Reference

### Backend
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database models
- `server/src/services/incident-management.service.ts` - Incident logic
- `server/src/services/runbooks.service.ts` - Runbook logic
- `server/src/routes/admin-ops.router.ts` - API endpoints

### Frontend
- `client/src/components/ops/HealthIncidentsViewNew.tsx` - Main incidents view
- `client/src/components/ops/RunbooksToolsViewNew.tsx` - Main runbooks view
- `client/src/components/ops/incidents/IncidentKPIs.tsx` - KPI cards
- `client/src/components/ops/incidents/IncidentFilters.tsx` - Filter panel
- `client/src/components/ops/incidents/IncidentBoardDnD.tsx` - Drag-drop board

## üí° Tips

1. **Use Filters** - Start with status filter to focus on active work
2. **Drag Workflow** - Drag incidents through board columns for status updates
3. **Quick Search** - Use search in runbooks to find procedures fast
4. **Mark Reviewed** - Keep runbooks current by reviewing regularly
5. **Execute Safely** - Only executable runbooks have automation; others are manual guides

## üéØ Success Metrics

Track these to validate the system:
- Mean Time To Mitigate (MTTM) trending down
- Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR) trending down
- SLA breach count at 0 or near 0
- Post-mortem completion rate for SEV1/2 at 100%
- Runbook staleness (should review every 90 days)

## üîê Security Notes

- All operations require admin authentication
- Winston logs every incident/runbook change
- Markdown is sanitized by react-markdown
- Audit trail in database for compliance
- SLA breach events logged for review
