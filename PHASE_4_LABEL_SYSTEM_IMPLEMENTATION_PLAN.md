- **JSON-based rules**: Simple, readable business logic
- **Conditional visibility**: Show/hide elements based on data
- **Data transformation**: Format dates, currencies, calculations
- **Field mapping**: Dynamic content based on order/product data
- **Rule templates**: Pre-built rules for common scenarios

### **Example Rule**:
```json
{
  "id": "priority-shipping-rule",
  "name": "Priority Shipping Indicator",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "field": "order.priority",
      "operator": "equals",
      "value": "URGENT"
    },
    {
      "field": "order.shippingMethod", 
      "operator": "contains",
      "value": "express"
    }
  ],
  "operator": "AND",
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "showElement",
      "target": "priority-badge",
      "properties": {
        "text": "🚨 URGENT",
        "backgroundColor": "#ff0000",
        "textColor": "#ffffff"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "transform",
      "target": "shipping-text",
      "transform": "uppercase"
    }
  ]
}
```
