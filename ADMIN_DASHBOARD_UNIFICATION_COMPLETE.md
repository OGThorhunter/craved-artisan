# Admin Dashboard Unification - Complete ‚úÖ

**Date**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Successfully Completed

## Problem Solved

Previously, there were **two separate admin dashboards** causing navigation confusion:

1. **`AdminDashboard.tsx`** at `/admin` - Newer dashboard with beautiful left sidebar navigation
2. **`AdminDashboardPage.tsx`** at `/dashboard/admin` - Older dashboard with horizontal tabs
3. **Support page** at `/control/support` had "Back to Dashboard" button that went to the wrong place

## Solution Implemented

‚úÖ **Unified into single admin dashboard** at `/dashboard/admin` with left sidebar navigation

9. Search & AI - Search and AI health

**Changed:**
