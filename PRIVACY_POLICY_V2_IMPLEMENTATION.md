### 2. Database Seeding

```

**Result:** ✅ Successfully created Privacy & Data Use Policy v2.0

### 3. Enforcement for All User Roles
**File:** `server/src/routes/auth.ts`

### 4. Logging Configuration
**File:** `server/src/logger.ts`

The project uses **Pino logger** (not Winston) with:
- Info level logging in production
- Pretty formatting in development
- Logging throughout legal document retrieval and registration process

**Key Logged Events:**
- Legal document retrieval (type and version)
- User registration with agreement acceptance count
- Failed registrations due to missing agreements
- Agreement acceptance validation
