# ðŸš€ Sentry Quick Setup Guide

## âœ… **Your Sentry is Working!**

I can see from your logs that Sentry is already capturing errors perfectly:

- âœ… **Port conflicts** (`EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001`)
- âœ… **Redis version issues** (`Redis version needs to be greater or equal than 5.0.0`)
- âœ… **Database connection issues** (`Prisma Client connection failed`)

## ðŸŽ¯ **How to Access Your Sentry Data**

### **Option 1: Direct Dashboard Access (Easiest)**
1. **Go to**: https://sentry.io
2. **Login** to your account
3. **Find your project** (look for "craved-artisan-backend" or similar)
4. **Check the Issues tab** - you should see all the errors we've been tracking

### **Option 2: Get the Right Token**
To use the MCP integration scripts, you need a token with the right permissions:

1. **Go to**: https://sentry.io/settings/auth-tokens/
2. **Create a new token** with these scopes:
   - `project:read`
   - `project:releases`
   - `org:read`
3. **Copy the token** and add it to your `.env` file

### **Option 3: Use the Data We Already Have**
Since Sentry is working, let me create a simple script that reads your current error data:
