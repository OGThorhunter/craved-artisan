# Testing the Notification System Fix

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Application
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Notification System
1. **Login as a Vendor**
   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Use vendor credentials

2. **Navigate to Orders Page**
   - Click on "Orders" in the vendor dashboard
   - **BEFORE**: Multiple toast alerts would appear on the right margin
   - **AFTER**: No toast alerts should appear

3. **Check Notification Bell**
   - Look at the bell icon (ðŸ””) in the top navigation bar
   - Should see a red badge with the number of unread notifications
   - Badge should show "9+" if more than 9 unread

4. **Open Notifications Dropdown**
   - Click or hover over the bell icon
   - Should see a dropdown with production alerts
   - Each notification shows:
     - Emoji icon based on type
     - Title and message
     - Timestamp ("2 hours ago", "Just now", etc.)
     - Unread indicator (green dot)

5. **Interact with Notifications**
   - Click on a notification â†’ should mark as read and navigate to orders page
   - Click "Mark all read" â†’ all notifications should become read
   - Close and reopen â†’ read status should persist

6. **Verify No Popup Blocker Warnings**
   - Check browser console for any popup blocker warnings
   - Should be none

## Expected Behavior

### Orders Page Load
- âœ… No toast popups appear
- âœ… Page loads normally
- âœ… Production alerts added to notification system silently

### Notification Bell
- âœ… Badge shows correct unread count
- âœ… Badge disappears when all read
- âœ… Dropdown opens smoothly

### Notification Dropdown
- âœ… Shows all notifications (up to 10 visible)
- âœ… Scrollable if more than 10
- âœ… Click notification marks as read
- âœ… Shows empty state if no notifications
- âœ… "Mark all read" button works
- âœ… Notifications persist across refreshes

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Multiple Production Alerts
1. Have 5+ orders that need production
2. Navigate to orders page
3. Verify no toast popups
4. Check notification bell shows count
5. Open dropdown - should see 5+ production alerts

### Scenario 2: Notification Persistence
1. Add notifications by visiting orders page
2. Refresh the page
3. Check notification bell - count should remain
4. Notifications should still be there

### Scenario 3: Mark as Read
1. Open notification dropdown
2. Click a notification
3. Should navigate and mark as read
4. Unread count should decrease by 1
5. Notification styling should change (less prominent)

### Scenario 4: Mark All Read
1. Have multiple unread notifications
2. Open dropdown
3. Click "Mark all read"
4. All notifications should become read
5. Badge should disappear
6. Button should disappear

### Scenario 5: Empty State
1. Clear browser localStorage
2. Refresh page
3. Open notification dropdown
4. Should see "No notifications" message with bell icon

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Badge not showing
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify NotificationContext is imported in App.tsx
- Check localStorage for `notifications` key

### Issue: Notifications not persisting
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Clear cache and try again
- Check for console errors

### Issue: Click not working
- Check `actionUrl` is set correctly
- Verify navigation routing is working
- Check browser console for errors

## Browser Console Tests

Open browser console and run:
```javascript
// Check if notifications context is available
localStorage.getItem('notifications')

// Manually add a test notification
const testNotif = {
  id: 'test-' + Date.now(),
  type: 'system',
  title: 'Test Notification',
  message: 'This is a test',
  timestamp: new Date(),
  read: false,
  priority: 'high'
};
localStorage.setItem('notifications', JSON.stringify([testNotif]));
// Then refresh page
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Dropdown displays notifications correctly
- [ ] Click notification marks as read
- [ ] Mark all read works
- [ ] Notifications persist across refreshes
