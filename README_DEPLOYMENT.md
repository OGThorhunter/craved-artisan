## üéØ Your Next Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Test Locally with PostgreSQL (Required)

**Before deploying, you MUST test locally:**

```bash
# Install PostgreSQL
choco install postgresql  # Windows
brew install postgresql@15  # Mac

# Create database
psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE craved_artisan_local;
\q

# Update server/.env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/craved_artisan_local"

# Run migrations
cd server
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init_postgres

# Test
npm run dev:server  # Terminal 1
npm run dev:client  # Terminal 2
```

**Verify:** Create account, login, create products, no errors

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Get Your Credentials

#### Required:
- [ ] **Stripe Keys** from https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
  - Secret key (sk_test_...)
  - Publishable key (pk_test_...)

#### Recommended:
- [ ] **Redis** from https://upstash.com/ (free tier)
  - Connection string (rediss://...)

#### Optional:
- [ ] **OpenAI** from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys ($20-50/mo)
- [ ] **Cloudinary** from https://cloudinary.com/ (free tier)

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy

Follow either:
- **Quick:** `DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md` (30 min)
- **Thorough:** `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (2-3 hours)

---

## üí∞ Cost Overview

### Minimum Production Setup: $14/month

- Render Web Service (Starter): $7/mo
- Render PostgreSQL (Starter): $7/mo
- Upstash Redis (Free tier): $0/mo
- SSL Certificate: $0/mo (included)

**Plus:** Stripe transaction fees only (2.9% + $0.30)

### With All Features: $44/month

- Base MVP: $14/mo
- OpenAI API: $30/mo (moderate usage)
- Cloudinary: $0/mo (free tier sufficient initially)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

### üî¥ Critical: Test PostgreSQL Locally First
Your app currently uses SQLite (`dev.db`). PostgreSQL has subtle differences. **You must test locally before deploying!**

See: `DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md` Step 1

### üü° File Uploads Won't Work
Local file storage (`server/uploads/`) won't persist on Render. You need cloud storage.

**Options:**
1. Disable uploads initially (recommended)
2. Configure Cloudinary (free tier available)

See: `FILE_UPLOAD_WARNING.md` for details

### üü¢ Sessions Without Redis
Without Redis, user sessions reset on every deploy/restart.

**Solution:** Use Upstash free tier (10k commands/day)

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Flight Checklist

Before you start:

- [ ] Read `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` (this helped you decide)
- [ ] Local PostgreSQL testing completed
- [ ] Stripe keys obtained
- [ ] Decided on Redis (yes recommended)
- [ ] Decided on AI features (no initially recommended)
- [ ] Decided on file uploads (disable initially recommended)
- [ ] Budget approved (~$14/month)
- [ ] Have 30 minutes to 2 hours available
- [ ] Not deploying late at night

**If all checked:** Proceed to `DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md`

**If missing items:** Review `PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`

## üéØ Recommended Deployment Strategy

### Week 1: Minimal MVP
- ‚úÖ Core features only
- ‚úÖ Redis sessions (free tier)
- ‚ùå No AI features
- ‚ùå No file uploads
- **Cost:** $14/month

### Week 2+: Add Features Based on User Feedback
- Add Cloudinary for file uploads (still $14/mo)
- Consider AI features if users request
- Enable OAuth if users request

---

## üìä What Will Work After Deployment

### ‚úÖ Working Features:
- User authentication (signup/login)
- Vendor dashboard
- Product management (without image uploads initially)
- Marketplace browsing
- Search functionality
- Order management
- Stripe payments
- Analytics dashboard
- Session persistence (with Redis)

### ‚è≥ Needs Additional Setup:
- File uploads (need Cloudinary)
- AI features (need OpenAI key)
- OAuth login (need Google/Facebook)
- Receipt parsing (needs AI)
- Product image uploads (needs Cloudinary)

## üÜò If You Need Help

### During Deployment:
1. Check the relevant guide's troubleshooting section
2. Render docs: https://render.com/docs
3. Render community: https://community.render.com

### Common Issues:

**"Build failing"**
‚Üí Run `npm run build` locally first

**"Database connection error"**
‚Üí Check DATABASE_URL in Render environment

**"CORS errors"**
‚Üí Check FRONTEND_URL matches your deployment

**"Sessions not persisting"**
‚Üí Add REDIS_URL or accept in-memory storage
