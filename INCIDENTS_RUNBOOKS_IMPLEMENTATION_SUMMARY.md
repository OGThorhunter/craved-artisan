# Incidents & Runbooks Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the comprehensive Incidents & Runbooks management system for the Operations Dashboard.

## What's Been Implemented

### Phase 1: Database Schema (✅ Complete)
- **Extended Incident Model** with new fields:
  - `ownerId`, `tags`, `summary`, `mitigatedAt`, `closedAt`
  - `slaMitigateMinutes`, `slaCloseMinutes` for SLA tracking
  - Relations to User, Runbook, IncidentEvent, and Postmortem

- **New Models**:
  - `IncidentEvent`: Timeline entries with types (NOTE, ACTION, UPDATE, MITIGATION, IMPACT, ROOT_CAUSE)
  - `Postmortem`: Post-incident analysis with action items
  - `RunbookExecution`: Track runbook usage and checklist progress

- **Enhanced Runbook Model** with:
  - `service`, `tags`, `severityFit` arrays
  - `contentMarkdown`, `executable`, `version`
  - `ownerId`, `lastReviewedAt`, `reviewCadenceDays`
  - `bindings`, `estimatedDuration`, `requiredRoles`, `prerequisites`, `rollbackPlan`

### Phase 2: Backend Services & API (✅ Complete)

### Dependencies Installed
- `@dnd-kit/core` - Drag-and-drop functionality
- `@dnd-kit/utilities` - DnD utilities
- `react-markdown` - Markdown rendering
- `remark-gfm` - GitHub Flavored Markdown support

## How to Use

### Enabling the New Views
The new components are separate files. To enable them in OperationsDashboard:

1. Import the new views in `client/src/components/OperationsDashboard.tsx`:
```typescript
import HealthIncidentsViewNew from './ops/HealthIncidentsViewNew';
import RunbooksToolsViewNew from './ops/RunbooksToolsViewNew';
```

2. Replace the old views:
```typescript
{selectedView === 'health' && <HealthIncidentsViewNew />}
{selectedView === 'runbooks' && <RunbooksToolsViewNew />}
```

### Using the Incident Board
1. View KPIs at the top showing real-time metrics
2. Expand filters to narrow down incidents
3. Drag incident cards between columns to change status
4. Click on an incident to view details (detail drawer to be implemented)
5. Board auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

### Using Runbooks
1. Search runbooks by title, content, or tags
2. Click a runbook card to view full details
3. Execute runbooks marked as "Executable"
4. Mark stale runbooks as reviewed to update timestamp
5. View markdown-rendered procedures with syntax highlighting

## What's Partially Implemented / Needs Enhancement

1. **Incident Detail Drawer** - Placeholder modal exists, needs full implementation with:
   - Overview tab (edit title, severity, status, owner, services, tags)
   - Timeline tab (add events, view history)
   - Post-mortem tab (structured form with action items)
   - Actions bar (notify on-call, copy summary, attach runbook)

2. **Policy Prompts** - Need to add:
   - Modal prompt when closing without post-mortem
   - SEV1/SEV2 post-mortem due within 48h reminders
   - SLA breach warnings

3. **Runbook Creation Form** - Placeholder exists, needs:
   - Full form with markdown editor
   - Template selection
   - Service/severity/tags multi-select
   - Binding configuration for executable runbooks

4. **Runbook Checklist Mode** - Need to implement:
   - Step-by-step execution tracking
   - Checkbox per step
   - Assignee picker
   - Timestamp recording
   - Auto-post to incident timeline if attached

5. **Cross-linking** - Need to enhance:
   - Attach runbook to incident from incident detail
   - Pre-fill incident creation from health status
   - Auto-post runbook steps to incident timeline

6. **Post-mortem Features** - Need separate component:
   - Structured form (what happened, root cause, contributing factors, lessons)
   - Action items table with owner/due date/status
   - Save with audit logging

## Winston Logging
All critical operations are logged per user requirements:
- Incident CRUD operations
- Status changes
- Event additions
- Post-mortem saves
- Runbook creation/updates
- Runbook execution starts
- Runbook reviews
- SLA breaches

Example log:
```typescript
logger.info({ incidentId: incident.id, severity: data.severity, title: data.title }, 'Incident created');
```

## SLA Calculations
Default SLA targets by severity:
- **SEV1**: 15 minutes to mitigate, 2 hours to resolve
- **SEV2**: 1 hour to mitigate, 8 hours to resolve
- **SEV3**: 4 hours to mitigate, 24 hours to resolve
- **SEV4**: 24 hours to mitigate, 7 days to resolve

SLA status displayed with color coding:
- **Green**: On track (>20% time remaining)
- **Yellow**: Warning (<20% time remaining)
- **Red**: Breached

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. **High Priority**:
   - Complete Incident Detail Drawer with all tabs
   - Implement Post-mortem Form component
   - Add policy prompts for closing without post-mortem
   - Build Runbook Creation Form

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Implement Runbook Checklist Mode
   - Add cross-linking between incidents and runbooks
   - Build Incident Timeline component with event composer
   - Add owner/team assignment UI

3. **Nice to Have**:
   - Export incidents to PDF/JSON
   - Runbook versioning UI
   - Related incidents display
   - Automation binding execution with confirmation
   - Integration with external systems (Jira, GitHub, PagerDuty)

## Known Issues / Considerations

1. **Prisma Generation**: May need to restart dev server after schema changes
2. **Drag-and-Drop**: Works on desktop, may need touch event support for mobile
3. **Markdown Security**: Using react-markdown which sanitizes by default
4. **Performance**: With many incidents, consider pagination
5. **Real-time Updates**: Currently polling (30-60s), could add WebSocket for true real-time

## Conclusion

The core infrastructure for Incidents & Runbooks management is complete and functional. The system provides:
- Comprehensive incident tracking with SLA monitoring
- Drag-and-drop incident board
- Advanced filtering and search
- Runbook catalog with markdown rendering
- Execution tracking framework
- Full audit logging

The remaining work focuses on polish and advanced features (detailed incident drawer, post-mortem forms, runbook creation UI, policy prompts, and cross-linking enhancements).
