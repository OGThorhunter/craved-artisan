#### Architecture
```
server/src/
├── controllers/
│   └── ai-validation.ts               # AI validation controller
├── routes/
│   └── ai-validation.ts               # AI validation routes

#### Validation Logic
```typescript
interface AIValidationResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  confidence: number; // 0-1 confidence score
  warnings: string[];
  suggestions: string[];
  riskLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  marketComparison?: {
    averageMargin: number;
    priceRange: { min: number; max: number };

  cost: number,
  targetMargin?: number,
  productCategory?: string,
  marketData?: any,
  config: Partial<MarginAlertConfig> = {}
): MarginCalculation {
  const baseCalculation = calculateMargin(price, cost, targetMargin, config);
  const aiValidation = validateCostToMargin(price, cost, targetMargin, productCategory, marketData);

  return {
    ...baseCalculation,
    aiValidation
  };
}
