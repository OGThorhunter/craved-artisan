## 🔄 Data Flow

```
Daily (1 AM):
  CostSnapshot created with estimates
  ↓
Monthly (Admin):
  Update manual cost overrides → Winston logs
  Add/Update staff members → Winston logs
  ↓
Monthly (1st @ 3 AM):
  Cron job generates ProfitLossSnapshot
  - Aggregates RevenueSnapshot records
  - Aggregates CostSnapshot records (with overrides)
  - Calculates prorated staff costs
  - Computes totals and margins
  → Winston logs
  ↓
Anytime:
  Admin views P&L Dashboard
  - Fetches monthly or yearly data
  - Displays KPIs, charts, and tables
  - Shows 12-month trend
```

## 🎓 Business Calculations

- **Gross Profit** = Total Revenue - Operating Costs (infrastructure only)
- **Net Profit** = Total Revenue - Total Costs (infrastructure + staff)
- **Profit Margin** = (Net Profit / Total Revenue) × 100
- **Staff Cost (Prorated)** = (Annual Salary / 365) × Days Worked in Period
- **Effective Cost** = Manual Override ?? Estimated Cost
