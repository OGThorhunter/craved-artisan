## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

1. **Stripe Integration** - Currently uses stub data, needs real Stripe API keys for production
2. **TaxJar Integration** - Stub implementation, needs real TaxJar account
3. **Email/SMS** - SendGrid/Twilio integration needed for notifications
4. **File Uploads** - Document vault needs S3 or storage integration
5. **Cron Jobs** - Need node-cron or similar for production scheduling
6. **2FA/MFA** - MFA enforcement logic needs implementation
7. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket integration for live session monitoring

## Performance Considerations

1. **Pagination** - All lists paginated (50 per page)
2. **Indexes** - Proper database indexes on filtered fields
3. **Lazy Loading** - Tabs load data only when accessed
4. **Caching** - React Query caches all API responses
5. **Bulk Operations** - Batched processing for large operations

## Security Considerations

1. **Audit Trail** - Every destructive action logged to AdminAudit
2. **IP Tracking** - All admin actions track IP address
3. **Reason Required** - Sensitive actions require reason
4. **Confirmation** - Destructive actions require typed confirmation
5. **RBAC** - Role-based access control enforced
6. **Impersonation** - Time-limited with audit trail
