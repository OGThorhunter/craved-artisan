## 🔍 What You'll See for Your Signup Issue

When a user tries to sign up and it fails, Sentry will capture:

### Error Details:
```
Error: Unexpected end of JSON input
  at SignupPage.tsx:352
  
Tags:
  component: signup
  step: final_submission
  role: VENDOR
  
Context:
  email: user@example.com
  currentStep: complete
  hasProfileData: true
  agreementsCount: 5
  stripeCompleted: false
  
Browser: Chrome 120.0.0
OS: Windows 10
URL: https://cravedartisan.com/signup
```

### Performance Trace:
```
Span: "Complete Signup Submission" (2.3s)
  ├─ Child: "POST /api/auth/signup/complete" (2.1s) ❌ FAILED
  │  Status: 500
  │  Response: Empty (0 bytes)
  └─ Attributes:
     role: VENDOR
     hasProfileData: true
     agreementsCount: 5
```

### Structured Logs:
```
[INFO] Starting signup submission
  role: VENDOR
  email: user@example.com
  step: complete

[ERROR] Signup submission failed
  role: VENDOR
  email: user@example.com
  step: complete
  error: Unexpected end of JSON input
```

This tells you **exactly** what went wrong instead of guessing!

## 🎯 How This Solves Your Signup Problem

### Before Sentry:
```
❌ "Failed to complete signup"
❌ "Unexpected end of JSON input"
❌ No idea what's actually failing
❌ Guessing between CORS, sessions, database
```

### With Sentry:
```
✅ Exact error: "Prisma connection timeout after 5000ms"
✅ Location: auth.ts:475 in signup endpoint
✅ User context: john@example.com trying to signup as VENDOR
✅ Timing: Database query took 5.2 seconds
✅ Root cause: Database connection pool exhausted
```

**You'll know the exact problem in seconds instead of hours of debugging!**

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test Frontend (Do This Now)
- [x] Run `window.testSentry()` in browser console
- [ ] Check Sentry dashboard for test data
- [ ] Try the actual signup flow
- [ ] Review the error in Sentry

### 2. Set Up Backend (Next)
Once you see frontend errors working, we'll set up the Node.js backend:
- Create second Sentry project
- Install backend packages
- Add error tracking to API endpoints
- See server-side errors (database, sessions, CORS)

### 3. Fix Your Signup Issue
With both frontend and backend tracking:
- You'll see the exact error on both sides
- Know if it's a frontend or backend issue
- Get the root cause immediately
- Fix it confidently

## 💡 Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Error Tracking
```typescript
// Capture exceptions with context
Sentry.captureException(error, {
  tags: { component: 'signup', step: 'final_submission' },
  extra: { email, role, currentStep },
  level: 'error',
});
```

### 2. Performance Tracing
```typescript
// Track operation performance
Sentry.startSpan(
  { op: 'signup.submit', name: 'Complete Signup Submission' },
  async (span) => {
    span.setAttribute('role', formData.role);
    // ... your code
    span.setStatus({ code: 1, message: 'ok' });
  }
);
```

### 3. Structured Logging
```typescript
// Searchable logs with attributes
logger.info('Starting signup submission', {
  role: formData.role,
  email: formData.email,
  step: currentStep,
});
```

### 4. API Call Tracking
```typescript
// Track API performance
const response = await Sentry.startSpan(
  { op: 'http.client', name: 'POST /api/auth/signup/complete' },
  async () => await api.post('/auth/signup/complete', data)
);
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Nothing showing in Sentry"
1. Check that DSN is correct in `.env`
2. Make sure dev server restarted after adding DSN
3. Check browser console for Sentry errors
4. Verify you're looking at the correct project in Sentry

### "Test function not found"
1. Make sure dev server is running
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. Try: `window.testSentry()`

### "Errors not captured"
1. Check browser console for actual errors
2. Verify Sentry initialized (check console on page load)
3. Check `beforeSend` filter isn't blocking errors
