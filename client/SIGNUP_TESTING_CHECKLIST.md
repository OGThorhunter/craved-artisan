[INFO] User profile setup completed { userId: "...", role: "CUSTOMER" }
```

### 4. OAuth Integration Testing
**Google OAuth Flow:**
1. Click "Continue with Google" button
2. Redirected to Google OAuth consent screen
3. Grant permissions
4. Redirected back to `/signup?oauth=google&step=profile` 
5. Select account type (still required)
6. Skip credentials step (auto-filled from OAuth)
7. Continue with profile ‚Üí legal ‚Üí complete

**Facebook OAuth Flow:**
1. Click "Continue with Facebook" button  
2. Redirected to Facebook OAuth consent screen
3. Grant permissions
4. Redirected back to `/signup?oauth=facebook&step=profile`
5. Continue signup flow

**Expected Winston Logs:**
```
[INFO] OAuth login successful { userId: "...", email: "...", provider: "google" }
[INFO] OAuth login successful { userId: "...", email: "...", provider: "facebook" }
```

## üîç Validation Points

### UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Progress indicator shows correct step and completion status
- [ ] Navigation buttons (Back/Next) work properly
- [ ] Form validation displays appropriate error messages
- [ ] Loading states show during API calls
- [ ] Toast notifications appear for success/error actions
- [ ] OAuth buttons redirect correctly and handle responses
- [ ] Legal agreement documents load and expand properly
- [ ] Stripe onboarding explains requirements and can be skipped
- [ ] Email verification page handles all token states (valid/invalid/expired)

### API Integration Testing  
- [ ] All signup API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Legal documents API returns role-specific documents
- [ ] OAuth endpoints handle authentication flow
- [ ] Email verification API processes tokens correctly
- [ ] Error responses include proper error messages
- [ ] Session management works across signup flow

### Data Persistence Testing
- [ ] User account created in database after step 1
- [ ] Profile data saved correctly for each role type
- [ ] Legal agreement acceptances recorded with metadata (IP, user agent)
- [ ] Email verification status updated correctly
- [ ] Sessions persist across page refreshes during signup

### Error Handling Testing
- [ ] Network errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Invalid form data rejected with clear messages  
- [ ] Duplicate email addresses prevented
- [ ] Expired verification tokens handled properly
- [ ] OAuth failures redirect with error messages
- [ ] Missing legal agreements prevent progression

## üìä Winston Log Monitoring

### Key Log Events to Monitor
1. **Signup Initiation:** User starts signup process
2. **Account Creation:** Step 1 completion with basic info
3. **Profile Completion:** Role-specific profile saved
4. **Legal Acceptance:** Agreements accepted with metadata
5. **Email Verification:** Verification email sent and processed
6. **OAuth Events:** Social login successes and failures
7. **Error Events:** All signup-related errors with context

### Log Format Examples
```
[INFO] User signup step 1 completed {
  "userId": "cuid...",
  "email": "user@example.com", 
  "role": "VENDOR"
}

[INFO] User registered and accepted legal agreements {
  "userId": "cuid...",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "VENDOR", 
  "agreementCount": 5
}

[ERROR] Signup step 1 error {
  "error": "User with this email already exists",
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Implementation Notes
1. **Stripe Integration:** Uses placeholder/mock implementation for signup flow
   - Real Stripe Connect onboarding available in dashboard post-signup
   - Signup flow allows skipping with warning message

2. **OAuth Setup:** Requires environment variables to be configured
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` and `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`
   - Shows configuration messages if not set up

3. **Email Service:** Verification emails sent if service configured
   - Graceful fallback if email service unavailable
   - Manual verification possible via dashboard

### Recommended Follow-ups
- [ ] Set up actual OAuth applications in Google/Facebook developer consoles
- [ ] Configure production email service (SendGrid, SES, etc.)
- [ ] Implement real Stripe Connect onboarding in signup flow
- [ ] Add comprehensive error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Implement signup analytics and funnel tracking
- [ ] Add automated testing for critical signup paths
