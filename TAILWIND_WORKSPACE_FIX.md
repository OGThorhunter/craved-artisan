# 🔧 Tailwind CSS Workspace Fix - COMPLETE

## ✅ **Issue Resolved Successfully**

### **Problem:**
```
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '...\node_modules\tailwindcss\lib\css\preflight.css'
```

### **Root Cause:**
The root package.json had conflicting dependencies (`@prisma/client`) and was trying to resolve Tailwind CSS from the wrong location when running `npm run dev` from the root.

### **Solution Applied:**
1. **Removed conflicting dependency**: Removed `@prisma/client` from root package.json
2. **Updated dev script**: Changed root dev script to run client directly
3. **Simplified workspace setup**: Avoided concurrently dependency issues
