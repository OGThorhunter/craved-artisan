|---------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Stripe** | Transaction fees only | 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction | Payment processing |

**Stripe Cost Example:**
- $1,000 in sales = $29 + $3 = $32 in fees
- $10,000 in sales = $290 + $30 = $320 in fees

### Optional Services (Cost Optimization)

| Support ticket AI | $0.001/ticket | $2-10/mo (2000-10k tickets) |
| **Total** | | **$17-70/month** for AI features |

**Cost Saving Tips:**
- Start with AI disabled
- Enable selectively per feature
- Cache AI responses
- Use cheaper models (gpt-3.5-turbo vs gpt-4)

#### Cloud Storage (File Uploads)

| Provider | Free Tier | Paid Plans | Best For |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------|

**Usage Estimates:**
- 100 products × 3 images × 500KB = 150MB
- 1000 products = 1.5GB (fits in free tier)
- 10,000 products = 15GB ($89/mo Cloudinary)

**Cost Saving Tips:**
- Compress images before upload
- Use appropriate sizes (don't store 4K images)
- Delete unused files
- Start with Cloudinary free tier

#### OAuth (Social Login)

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Start Small, Scale Smart

```
Month 1-2:  Free tier ($0) - Test deployment
Month 3-4:  Starter ($14) - Launch with early users
Month 5-8:  Starter + AI ($34) - Enable features gradually
Month 9+:   Standard ($60+) - Scale based on metrics
```

### 2. Feature Gating

**Progressive feature rollout:**
1. **Phase 1 (Free):** Auth, products, basic marketplace
2. **Phase 2 (+$0):** File uploads (Cloudinary free tier)
3. **Phase 3 (+$20):** AI features (light usage)
4. **Phase 4 (+$20):** Scale infrastructure as needed

### 3. Monitor and Optimize

**Weekly checks:**
- [ ] Database size (upgrade warning at 80%)
- [ ] Redis command count (stay under 10k/day)
- [ ] OpenAI token usage
- [ ] Bandwidth usage
- [ ] Error rate (affects Sentry costs)

**Monthly review:**
- Compare actual costs vs estimates
- Identify unused features
- Optimize expensive queries
- Clean up old data

### 4. Disable Expensive Features Initially

**In render.yaml, comment out:**
```yaml
# Optional: Disable cron jobs to save CPU
# - Audit verification (weekly)
# - P&L generation (monthly)
# - Support auto-close (daily)
```

**In environment:**
```bash
# Disable AI features
OPENAI_API_KEY=  # Leave blank
SUPPORT_AI_SUMMARIZE=false
SUPPORT_AI_CATEGORY=false
```

### 5. Use Free Alternatives

| Paid Service | Free Alternative | Trade-off |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| Render Standard | Render Starter | Less performance |
| Sentry Pro | Sentry Free (5k events) | Limited events |
| Cloudinary Paid | Cloudinary Free | Storage limit |
| Redis Paid | Redis Free (Upstash) | Command limit |

---

## Break-Even Analysis

### Revenue Needed to Cover Costs

**Starter Tier ($14/mo):**
- Need ~$50/mo in sales (after Stripe fees)
- Or 3-5 paid vendors at $5-10/mo each

**Standard Tier ($60/mo):**
- Need ~$200/mo in sales
- Or 10-15 paid vendors at $5-10/mo each

**Pro Tier ($225/mo):**
- Need ~$750/mo in sales
- Or 30-50 paid vendors at $5-10/mo each

### Platform Fee Recommendation

If charging 1% platform fee (render.yaml default):
- $14/mo costs = need $1,400/mo GMV
- $60/mo costs = need $6,000/mo GMV
- $225/mo costs = need $22,500/mo GMV
